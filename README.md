Information Management Project: Data Pipeline Framework

Specific Problem: Public-health teams often struggle to:
Combine case data from many sources (CSV, JSON, XML).


Check that reported case counts are valid and consistent.


Clean and standardize messy data (e.g., missing values, wrong dates).


Transform raw data into charts or tables for decision-makers.


Keep reports organized for different research projects.






Project Features & Scope

 We will design a modular research data pipeline framework to improve how disease case data is processed and analyzed.
Core Features (Must-Have)
Data Import: Read CSV, JSON, and XML case files.


Validation & Cleaning: Check for missing or invalid entries, fix simple errors.


Transformations: Aggregate data by date, location, or age group.


Basic Visualizations: Line charts for case counts, bar charts for locations.


Automated Report: Create a simple summary (tables + charts) for each dataset.


Configuration: Allow users to choose which steps (cleaning, charts, reports) run.


Nice-to-Have Features
Export cleaned datasets to new files.


More chart options (heatmaps, stacked bars).


Handle live data from APIs.


Save user settings for repeated analyses.


Email or PDF reports.



Growth & Complexity:

We’ll begin with a small, clear goal: load one public-health dataset, clean the data, and create a single chart showing case counts over time.
As we move along with the project, we can add:
Support for larger datasets.


New analysis tools, like moving averages or weekly incidence rates.


A simple menu or interface so users can choose what steps to run.


The framework will expand step by step, helping us learn while keeping the workload manageable.
