ChatGPT (GPT-5) was used for limited support in:
- Structuring medium and complex functions (cleaning and summary generation)
- Brainstorming error handling and date normalization strategies (e.g., using `.zfill()` for format consistency)
- Improving docstring formatting to align with project standards
